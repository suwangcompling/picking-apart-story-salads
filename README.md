### USE
Download the code and place them in a single folder. Run `sh run_pretrained.sh` to see results on 20 samples from the Gigaword (NYT). The clustering results will appear in the `out.txt` file (sample output is prepared in the current file). Due to publishing restrictions, we will upload a document reader for the Gigaword dataset soon.
